## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Set These in Railway UI

The Caddy server logs you're seeing mean Railway is auto-detecting your app type. You need to **manually override** this:

### For Frontend Service:

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **Build & Deploy** section
3. **CRITICAL**: Set these fields **manually**:
   - ‚úÖ Root Directory: `frontend`
   - ‚úÖ Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - ‚úÖ Start Command: `npx vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - ‚úÖ Install Command: `npm ci`

### For Backend Service:

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **Build & Deploy** section
3. Set these fields:
   - ‚úÖ Root Directory: `backend`
   - ‚úÖ Start Command: (see above - includes migrations)

---

## üîÑ After Setting These

1. **Commit and push** the updated files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix frontend deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Manually trigger redeploy** in Railway:
   - Go to each service
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

## üêõ If Frontend Still Shows Caddy Logs

This means Railway is still auto-detecting it as a static site. To fix:

1. Delete the frontend service completely
2. Create a new service from GitHub
3. Immediately go to Settings (before it finishes building)
4. Set all the settings above
5. Let it build

## ‚úÖ How to Verify It's Working

### Backend:
- Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app`
- Should show: `{"status":"ok","message":"SMT Production Scheduler API"}`

### Frontend:
- Visit: `https://your-frontend-url.railway.app`
- Should show: Login page with SMT Scheduler branding

## üìû Still Having Issues?

Check the deployment logs:

**If you see Caddy logs (admin endpoint, HTTPS disabled, etc.):**
- ‚ùå Railway is ignoring your start command
- ‚úÖ Fix: Manually set start command in Settings as shown above

**If you see "Module not found" errors:**
- ‚ùå Dependencies not installed
- ‚úÖ Fix: Check Root Directory is correct

**If you see "Cannot find module 'vite'":**
- ‚ùå Build didn't run or node_modules missing
- ‚úÖ Fix: Set Build Command to `npm ci && npm run build`

**If frontend shows blank page:**
- ‚ùå API URL not set or CORS issue
- ‚úÖ Fix: Check VITE_API_URL is set and FRONTEND_URL in backend matches
