## üêõ Known Issues to Check

### Potential Issues:
1. **Line position null** - Auto-assign should fix this
2. **Weekend positioning** - Should be fully fixed now
3. **Time calculations** - Verify times make sense
4. **Drag and drop** - Test thoroughly
5. **Modal forms** - Ensure they work on all pages

---

## üìù Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Job Workflow
1. Create unscheduled WO
2. View it in Schedule (should show ‚ö†Ô∏è Unscheduled)
3. Edit it and assign to Line 2
4. Position auto-assigns to end
5. Dates/times calculate automatically
6. View on Visual Scheduler
7. Drag to Line 3
8. Verify it recalculates
9. Complete the job
10. Verify it moves to Completed page

### Scenario 2: Multiple Jobs on One Line
1. Create 3 jobs on Line 2
2. All get sequential positions (1, 2, 3)
3. Times are sequential (Job 2 starts when Job 1 ends + buffer)
4. Weekends are skipped
5. Visual Scheduler shows them in order
6. Drag Job 3 to Line 1
7. Verify Line 2 renumbers (now just 1, 2)

### Scenario 3: Priority Override
1. Create job with late ship date
2. Set priority to "Critical Mass"
3. Verify it's flagged as high priority on dashboard
4. Should be considered for immediate scheduling

## üì§ Next Steps

1. **Go through this checklist** - Test each item
2. **Report any bugs** - I'll fix them immediately
3. **Once stable** - We'll move to Phase 2

## üíæ Phase 2 Saved

I've saved all the Phase 2 requirements (Capacity Calendar) in my memory. When you're ready, just say **"Let's do Phase 2"** and I'll continue building the capacity override system with:
- 8-week planning calendar
- Right-click menus for quick overrides
- Overtime, half-day, custom hours
- Visual capacity indicators
